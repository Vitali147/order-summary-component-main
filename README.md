### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://order-summary-component-main-hazel.vercel.app/)

## My process

-Initialised the project as a public repo on Github, configured it to publish on Vercel and started the project. First structured HTML and using flexbox added necessary properties to elements. Used mobile-first approach and once I was happy with draft design published first commit.
At this stage font-sizes, margins and card size were static and non-responsive. Then through trying and failing added responsiveness to some of these elements and added hover states.


### Built with

- CSS custom color variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This challenge helped me understand a bit more how flexbox work and I am definitely more confident now. Also I have used color variables for the first time and using vw as font size to reach required effect of gradually increasing font size as screen size increases. Most importantly - challenged myself and enjoyed working on this project.


### Continued development

Planning to continue tackling these projects gradually adding difficulty.
